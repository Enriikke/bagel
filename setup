welcome="
Welcome! Lets build an awesome dev machine together.
This might take a bit of time, so run me and then go
eat a bagel - don't forget to add cream cheese!
"

pause="
Ready to roll? Smash any key and let the magic begin.
(CTRL+C to stop)
"

finished="
It looks like we are finished here. Now go and enjoy
life inside your new dev environment!

BTW, did you save me any bagels?
"

chaos="
Oh no!! It looks like something failed. Checkout the
errors below and try running bagel again.
