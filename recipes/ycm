# Create a temporary holder directory for the make files
# If the folder already exist just wack it
rm -rf -- ~/ycm_build/
mkdir ~/ycm_build
cd ~/ycm_build

# Compile the libraries
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" . ~/.vim/vim-addons/github-Valloric-YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp/
make ycm_support_libs
